OpenRISC Multicore Programmable Interrupt Controller

Required properties:

- compatible : This should be "ompic"
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the register space. The
  size can be arbitrary based on the number of cores the controller has
  been configured to handle, typically 8 bytes per core.
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value shall be 1.
- interrupts : Specifies the interrupt line to which the ompic is wired.

Example:

ompic: ompic {
	compatible = "ompic";
	reg = <0x98000000 16>;
	#interrupt-cells = <1>;
	interrupt-controller;
	interrupts = <1>;
};
